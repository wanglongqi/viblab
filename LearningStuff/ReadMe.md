## SpectralAnalysis

This folder contains stuffs about the `Wave Propagation in Structures` written by `James F. Doyle`. It is a very good book on dynamic properties of structures. The ideas in the book are quite different from others in this field, which are attracting me to reread the book again carefully. I am hoping the files in the directory may help you read the book easier.
